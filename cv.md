### Personal summary
As a student, I was interested in how websites work, so in my free time I did layout, studied html and css. Later I got acquainted with such programming languages as JavaScript. All these Hobbies did not develop into something serious, but remained as a hobby.<br>
However, my desire to develop in the field of web development has not disappeared yet.
